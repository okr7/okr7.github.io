        <h1>Olivia Rodriguez</h1>

          <p> This website was originally created with the intent to share what I've been learning in my web design class. Soon I hope to be able to put the skills I learn in this class to creating a site dedicated to fashion and life style. I already have a site but I personally did not make it from scratch. So even though all the content is mine, I still want to be able to say I made the site... so stay tuned. In the mean time, here's a picture of an octocat to keep you busy and excited. Thanks for coming! </p>
